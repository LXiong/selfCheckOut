Appreciations:
	- Assigning tasks and user stories (Philip)
	- Clean, well-commented and test-driven code (Zafer)
	- clean and readable wiki page with everything on it (Sean)
	- excellent burn-down and velocity charts (Kevin)
	- well-done technical debt and documentation (Fahd)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Puzzles:
	- figuring out the formatting for the reports (especially numbers after
											the decinam point) (Zafer)
	- understanding customer's wishes and demands (everyone)
	- testing the GUI code (Kevin)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks:

	-grouping items by name eliminates the ability to see individual purchase
				times and amounts; managers/analyst might later need that info
	- choosing not to implement User Story 12: Search Field may prove to be
		disadvantageous in the long term as product database grows much larger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wishes:
	- completion of assignments by deadline (Zafer)
	- commited code to be documented and tested (Philip)
	- more consistent group member attendance (Kevin)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actions:
	1. consistent attendance with everyone's input
	2. committing complete and quality code (with documentation and testing),
									and accepting responsibility for own code
	3. prompt completion of tasks by deadline
	4. more communication within the team
	5. stronger analysis of the personas and what exactly they want from
														the program
	6. Address technical debts such as missing tests.
