Decision about points:
We are using pivotal tracker as our scrumboard which allows for 0, 1, 2 or 3
points per task, with 0's being chores or bugs. This is our interpretation
of them for the project:

1 point:			Easy task, able to complete within 30 min
2 points:			Medium task, able to complete within 60 min
3 points:			Hard task, able to complete within 90 min
0 points - bug:		A bug in the system; fixing it does not award any
					points as it is not a benefit to the user directly,
					since the user story which caused the bug already
					has all the "usefuleness points"
0 points - chore:	Tasks which do not provide direct usefuleness to the user,
					such as technical debt and other aspects related
					to the implementation or the documentation.

Note:	tasks which take more than 90 min to complete are
		broken down into smaller tasks.

Example story break-down: User Story 4: Reports over Time
Task breakdown:
	- return all records between two given dates:			3 points
	- parse the user input from the GUI:					3 points
	- connect the methods:									1 point

Total: 7 points

However, as the story was being implemented, the task breakdown was modified:

New task breakdown:
	- return all records between two given dates:			3 points
	- parse the user input from the GUI:					3 points
	- connect the methods:									1 point
	- create a visual calendar in the GUI:					3 points
	- refactor to separate calendar and reportsGUI classes:	0 points
	- parse GUI output to a Java calendar:					3 points
	- prevent the calendar from crashing on bad input:		2 points

Total: 15 points

Note: These changes in assessment are visible through the burn down chart.

Sprint planning:

Sprint 3:
User story 1: the GUI:										5 points
User story 2: the Output:									5 points
User story 3: Formatting & Styling:							10 points

Total: 20 points

Sprint 3 was meant to lay the groundwork for the next sprint. The initial GUI
for the reports was created, alnog with the output in record form. However, as
the Professor mentioned, there wasn't enough content generated in the sprint,
therefore the drastic difference in points between sprint 3 and 4.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sprint 4:
User story 4: Reports over Time:							15 points
User story 5: Names & Promotions:							5 points
User story 6: Sorting:										12 points
User story 9: Privacy & Protection:							7 points
User story 10: Reports GUI:									15 points
User story 11: Select from Category:						5 points

Total: 59 points

Final release was meant to finish off the work started in sprint 3. Most
importantly, the output of unhelpful records was modified to show the
products bought. Other changes for the benefit of the user, such as sorting
by all properties, choice of dates and category and a drastic change in the
GUI were added. These user stories were priorities over others, such as
forecasting since they form the dependincies for the further stories: for
example, user story 4: reports over time is necessary for user story 7:
forecasting, and both user stories 4 and 10 (reports GUI) are necessary for
user story 8: graphs and images.
