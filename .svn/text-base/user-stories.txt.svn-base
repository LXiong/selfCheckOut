User story 1: the GUI
As a manager, I want to view the reports using the GUI, so that I don't
have to print them to view it or necessarily write them to a file.

Discussion: Dorothy is no programmer and requested that reports should
			be accessible via simple clicking with the mouse; she further
			highlighted that she's usually busy with other tasks;
			Thus the GUI simplicity is key.

User story 2: the Output
As a manager, or marketing analyst, I want to be able to view the basic
information about records so that I can see people's trends by their shopping
carts.
The information should include the record id, along with the price, the tax,
the time, the payment method and the status.

Discussion: The technologically progressive marketing analyst, Mr. Tyrome said
			that therecord ID should be included too, for the sake of
			simplifying of finding certain items later in the database.

User story 3: Formatting & Styling
As a manager, I want the reports to be easily readable, clearly presented and
not have ridiculous decimal values so that I can do my work quickly and
efficiently.
	- the reports must be aligned
	- the time should have same format anytime: eleven hours 9 minutes
				should display as 11:09, not 11:9; any other zero formatting
													errors must be fixed
	- all prices and taxes must be rounded to 2 decimal places

Discussion: Dorothy has pretty poor eyesight; furthermore, she refuses to wear
			vision aid. Therefore clear big font is key. Other managers also
			desire a presentable and an easy-to-read report along with
			easy-to-find items. Tyrome further pointed out the ridicule of
			having dozens of decimal places in prices and the annoying time
			format.

User story 4: Reports over Time
As a manager, and especially as marketing analyst, I want to be able to
view the reports over specific time periods so that.. //
	- the user should be able to pick start and end date for reports
	- the 'picking' should be available in the GUI

Discussion: Marketing analyst, Tom said that the main reason for reports is
			watching and finding trends, and trends are inevitably
			related to time. The ability to view reports over specific
			time periods is crucial for analysing the business performance
			and performing forecasting.

User story 5: Names & Promotions
As a marketing analyst, I want to be able to view the specific products
in the records, so that I can analyze the trends by products, as opposed to
by customers and their shopping carts.
	- the management team realized that the 'records' themselves are not
												crucial for the reports
	- 'by item' information is much more valuable

Discussion: Manager Mohammed said that the name of the product is important
			for tracking progress. Furthermore, reports are the only
			way for judging a promotion's success, and Dorothy believes
			that promotions are one of the best ways to get customer
			to spend more money.

User story 6: Sorting
As a user, I want to be able to sort the report by category, quantity, time or
alphabetically, so that I can have a clear organized view that would make it easier for me
to spectate the reports and find trends. 

Discussion: Both managers and the marketing analyst find it hard to
			orient themselves amongst the records when they are sorted
			temporarily. They push for the ability to sort the report
			by different parameters, and the ability to sort by a
			different parameter by a single click of a button.

User story 7: Forecasting
As a manager, I want to be able produce a simple forecast based on
the given report, so that:
	- I can predict projected revenue
	- I can see projected quantities of # of items sold (especially on promotion)

Discussion: Dorothy and one of the managers are interested in automating of
			using the reports to forecast. Given that the main interest
			is revenue and finding out of most popular items,
			the forecasted report doesn't need to have detailed data
			about the individual records, but rather the total amount
			of revenue expected along with promotions. Dorothy is pushing
			to keep this report simple and instantly readable, saying
			that if she needs a more detailed report she'll put
			the marketing analyst Tom to work.

User story 8: Graphs & Images
As a manager or marketing analyst, I want to be able to see the reported data
in the form of graphs and infographics, so that I can easily percieve the data
relative to each other.
	- pie chart for items on promotion
	- line graph for revenue over time
	- bar graph for revenue by category


Discussion: Manager Mohammed is quite into all kinds of infographics. He
			believes that visual representation will quickly speed up
			the process and make the key data self-evident, eliminating
			the necessity of long, and boring report inspection. He wants
			the infographics to be abundant, colourful and bright.

User story 9: Privacy & Protection
As a user with restricted access (manager or marketing analyst), I would like to prohibit
unrestricted users from viewing the reports, so that I can protect my reports from being viewed 
by the public. 

Discussion: Managers are wary that anyone can access the all the reports,
			thus enabling sharing information with their competitors.

User story 10: Reports GUI //I think this form can be improved
As a manager or marketing analyst, I want to be able to use the software quickly
and with ease. This means that the sorting buttons should be easily distinguishable,
the reports info has to be spaced out and readable.

Discussion: Dorothy requested that the buttons should be of different colors, and
			a some form of representation for the selected sorting method. She also
			requested that the elements are big and well spaced out. Tom further
			suggested having alternating lines of different colors for the reports.
			During implementation process, Mohammed pointed out that the Calendar
			popup position is block some of the controls so the Calendar should be moved
			to a more intuitive position.

User story 11: Select from Category
As a manager or a marketing analyst, I would like to specify items to be
within a specific category, so that I can evaluate the traffic of the items sold in each
specific category. 

Discussion: Both managers and Tom agreed that a drop-down list with all current
			categories, along with an "All Categories" special selection option
			would be a sufficiently intuitive and simple implementation.
